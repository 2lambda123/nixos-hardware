= Dell XPS 15 9570 =

== Tested Hardware ==

* CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz
* RAM: 32 GB
* HDD: 256 GiB SSD
* Screen: 15" 4k (3840âœ•2160)
* Graphics: NVIDIA Corporation GP107M, with Intel Graphics too.
* Input: Touchscreen and trackpad.


== Firmware Configuration ==

Not much tweaking of NixOS itself was needed. But we currently cannot automate the firmware setup, so this must be done by hand.

=== Before installation ===

These settings are needed both for booting the final install, and installer itself. Therefore, they must be done first.

* ''Disable Secure Boot (but keep UEFI Boot).'' Thankfully doing so is as easy as changing any other simple setting.

* ''Disable Intel hardware RAID and use AHCI instead.'' Intel doesn't seem to provide a working linux driver for this.  (If you just have SSD it's pointless and just slows things down needlessly anyways.)


=== After installation ===

* ''Add systemd-boot to UEFI boot list.'' The (uneditable anyways) settings mapping drive UUIDs to HD* work fine.

=== Optional ===

* ''Update BIOS.'' According to Reddit, this helps with battery life.

* ''Update Intel's Thunderbolt firmware.'' Without this, the Thunderbolt port will only work as power source, and not transfer data.

=== Troubleshooting ===
